          <h2>What is neuroplasticity?
          </h2>
          <p>Neuroplasticity is the brain’s ability to learn and adapt.  
          </p>
          <p>Neuroscientists believe that people who become experts or elite performers are not born with a  superior brain, cognitive ability or memory.  They achieve this through practice and strengthening the relevant neural pathways in the brain.</p>
          <p>If people, especially children, can understand this, they can move from a fixed mindset to a growth mindset where they are more likely to put in effort to see results.</p>
          <p>Rather than believing that they were born with limited ability (<em>fixed mindset</em>), they can move to a <em>growth mindset</em> where they believe that they can improve, with practice and effort.  </p>
          <p>The brain fires when you are doing (or practising) something, but also when you are simply imagining doing it.  So as well as practice, activities like watching others do something or visualising yourself doing it can help you build strong pathways and improve your skills.</p>
          <p>I found an interesting resource called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjUregOtV_Q" target="_blank"><em>Ballet and the brain: The science of how dancers learn choreography</em></a>, which stated that this is what dancers are doing when they ‘run through’ dances in their minds or moving their hands only.</p></p>

          <h2>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?
          </h2>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Take an afternoon nap:  </strong>Sleep is important, not just at night.  A short afternoon nap of around 20 minutes encourages the growth of dendritic spines, which act as crucial connectors between the neurons in your brain. </li>
            <li><strong>Use the “wrong” hand:  </strong>If you’re right-handed, try brushing your teeth with your left hand – and then try it while balancing on one leg for a double neuroplasticity bonus.</li>
            <li><strong>Don’t let the work day linger:  </strong>Neuroplasticity needs downtime.  Create a “close the day” ritual that prioritises reflection and gratitude for small wins. Putting a hard stop to the stresses of the day in a way that also boosts endorphins creates perfect conditions for neuroplasticity.</li>
            <li><strong>Use mnemonic drills:  </strong>Teaching yourself mnemonic devices, like formulas or rhymes, can enhance connectivity in your prefrontal parietal network, paving the way to new, positive pathways in your brain. </li>
            <li><strong>Practice mindfulness:  </strong>Meditation helps with the positive brain rewiring process (while expanding several useful parts of the brain), it also results in team members reacting to problems with an increased sense of calm, passion, and awareness. </li>
          </ol>
