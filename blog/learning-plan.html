          <h2>Long-term goal
          </h2>
          <p class="blog-column-text">Keep practicing until I have the skills to contribute as an entry level web developer.</p>
          <h2>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?
          </h2>
          <p class="blog-column-text">My original strengths and limitations remain, but I have discovered another limitation which is to slow down with frustration, and grind to a halt when stuck.  I need to remind myself of quick fixes to break out of the pit and re-set (take a break, call a friend, stretch…)</p>
          <h2>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?
          </h2>
          <p class="blog-column-text">Balancing time with my kids, their activities and home life.</p>
          <h2>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?  
          </h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Improving my reflective skills and habits.</li>
            <li>Creating habits of taking breaks when getting bogged down.</li>
           </ul> 
          <h2>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?
          </h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Clear expectation of time commitment, timetable etc.</li>
            <li>Some flexibility for special events for children</li>
            <li>Support when needed (after other problem-solving techniques and peer support used) - within a reasonable timeframe.</li>
           </ul> 
           <h2>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp
           </h2>
           <p class="blog-column-text">I will commit to:</p>
           <ul>
            <li>Walk and from bootcamp (30min exercise built-in).</li>
            <li>Be focused and present in bootcamp hours.</li>
            <li>Learn about all opportunities to seek help / feedback /advice from the facilitators.</li>
            <li>Take advantage of the above.</li>
            <li>Make connections with other learners and offer support as well as asking for help.</li>
            <li>Make use of opportunities to meet industry/community representatives.</li>
            <li>Prioritise my kids outside bootcamp hours.</li>
            <li>Get to sleep by 10pm.</li>

        <div class="blogcolumn">
          <h2>Long-term goal
          </h2>
          <p class="blog-column-text">Entry-level web development role in a company with a mission which inspires me, and some parent-friendly work schedule flexibility.</p>
          <h2>Strengths and limitations
          </h2>
          <p class="blog-column-text"><strong>Strengths:  </strong>Quick reader, good memory.  </p>
          <p class="blog-column-text"><strong>Limitations:  </strong>Introversion, lack of confidence, shyness.</p>
          <h2>Which strengths might help you and how do they intersect with learning obstacles
          </h2>
          <p class="blog-column-text">Embracing my dominant read-write learning style, I can make good notes and retain information by reviewing them.  </p>
          <p class="blog-column-text">A learning obstacle of ‘getting distracted’ can be avoided by focusing on creating notes which will serve as a journal and reference later.</p>
          <h2>Share an example of trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension
          </h2>
          <p class="blog-column-text">Sometimes I experience frustration in group work due to my introversion.  Either I feel unable to get my ideas heard (as I find it hard to interrupt more confident people), or I sometimes feel unsure of how the project will be organised/delegated and don’t know how to clarify.</p>
          <p class="blog-column-text">Strategies I used are to try to pin down what ‘my’ secion of the project is and work alone on that.  Now, I would try to suggest another communication method for the group like Discord or Slack that would be easier to use to continue communication.</p>
          <p class="blog-column-text"></p>
