          <h2>Strengths and limitations
          </h2>
          <p class="blog-column-text"><strong>Strengths:  </strong>Quick reader, good memory.  </p>
          <p class="blog-column-text"><strong>Limitations:  </strong>Introversion, lack of confidence, shyness.</p>
          <h2>Which strengths might help you and how do they intersect with learning obstacles
          </h2>
          <p class="blog-column-text">Embracing my dominant read-write learning style, I can make good notes and retain information by reviewing them.  </p>
          <p class="blog-column-text">A learning obstacle of ‘getting distracted’ can be avoided by focusing on creating notes which will serve as a journal and reference later.</p>
          <h2>Share an example of trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension
          </h2>
          <p class="blog-column-text">Sometimes I experience frustration in group work due to my introversion.  Either I feel unable to get my ideas heard (as I find it hard to interrupt more confident people), or I sometimes feel unsure of how the project will be organised/delegated and don’t know how to clarify.</p>
          <p class="blog-column-text">Strategies I used are to try to pin down what ‘my’ secion of the project is and work alone on that.  Now, I would try to suggest another communication method for the group like Discord or Slack that would be easier to use to continue communication.</p>
