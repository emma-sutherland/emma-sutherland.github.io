          <h2>What is Emotional Intelligence?
          </h2>
          <p>
            Emotional intelligence (otherwise known as emotional quotient or EQ) is the ability to understand, use, and manage your own emotions in positive ways to relieve stress, communicate effectively, empathize with others, overcome challenges and defuse conflict.

          <h2>How is it different to IQ?
          </h2>
          <p>IQ tests measure your ability to solve problems, use logic, and grasp or communicate complex ideas. EQ tests measure your ability to recognize emotion in yourself and others, and to use that awareness to guide your decisions

        <h2>Why is it important?
        </h2>
        <p>Author Dan Goleman brought the concept of EQ into the mainstream with his 1995 book, Emotional Intelligence, which changed the way we think about what makes people and leaders successful. Having talent, skills and knowledge is not enough. You need to be able to effectively deal with all types of people.</p>
        <p>IQ and EQ are very different. Many people may have a high IQ with impressive analytical and technical skills. The questions we need to ask are: Whatâ€™s our EQ, and how am I showing up in the workplace as a leader?</p>
        <p>Companies are now focusing on EQ rather than just IQ. Employers would prefer employees with a good attitude and teach them additional skills rather than hiring technical wizards with low EQs.</p>
