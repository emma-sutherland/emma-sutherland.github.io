          </h2>
          <p>After tackling my first coding kata, I have felt frustrated and blocked multiple times.
          </p>
          <p>Although I’m not yet at a stage of elegantly solving problems, I do feel more confident and in control if I’m following a problem-solving process.    
          </p>
          <p>Below is the step-by-step problem solving process I’m trying to follow.  
          </p>

          <h2>Problem-solving in ten easy steps
          </h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Look at your kata problem.  What is the input and what is the output required?</li>
            <li>Draw a diagram (on paper or a whiteboard app) of the input and output.  Below this, try to think of the steps that would be needed to get from input to output.  E.g. Steps 1-5 or however many steps might be needed.  Write these in plain english.  E.g. Step 1:  Separate fullName into firstName and lastName.  This is called <em>pseudocode</em>.</li>
            <li>Start with Step 1.  Try to think of what variables and methods you would need to achieve this.  Google something like “js separate sentence” and read about the methods on MDN or W3 Schools.</li>
            <li>In your replit or sandbox, attempt to write your first step.</li>
            <li>Underneath it, use console.log() to check that the new variable looks how you imagined it, and test.</li>
            <li>If Step 1 looks good, move on to the next line for Step 2.  Repeat thinking / research / console.log until it works.</li>
            <li>If you get stuck… take a break, talk it over with your rubber ducky, google more, ask a friend or coach for help etc.</li>
            <li>If stuck for over 10mins, take a look at the answer.  This is ok as it is a form of learning.</li>
            <li>Looking at the answer, break it down into steps and see if your steps were similar, and where you got stuck.  Research any methods you didn’t know.</li>
            <li>Once you have an answer that works, take a break, then delete it and try to write it again.  Even try again in a few days, to make sure the knowledge is secure in your long-term memory.  Reflect on how the process felt the second time around.</li>
          </ol>
